# Noobish

## Introduction

Noobish is a component tree suitable for Elmish applications that lack decent native UI option. Current reference implementation is for MonoGame, but in theory other implementations could exist.

Buttons

Due to use of spritefonts, text will not be scaled. In future, there might be downscaling supported for text
